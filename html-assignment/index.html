            <p>I am 18 years old. Some of my regular activities are playing Video Games and Watching <abbr title="Television">TV</abbr>. I was adopted when I was 11 months old and have been living in Canada ever since. My favourite animal is a platypus because I got a <em>stuffed animal</em> of one when I was 6 and I now collect then.</p>
            
            <p>My favourite colour is Orange. I have a dog at home and his name is Jax. He's a Portugeuse water dog. My birthday is December 6<sup>th</sup>. I have a big family with 5 siblings, 3 brothers and 2 sisters. In my free time I like to spend time with my friends just doing whatever.</p>
